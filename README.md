# GalacticVote
Galactic Vote takes voting out of this world! Our website is meant to simplify the voting registration process by educating college students on how to vote, according to their status (in-state or out of state). 
##  Our Problem
**Voting in College is hard:**
Adulting for the First Time
Navigating a new State if Out of State
Requesting an Absentee Ballot?
Early Mailing Ballots?
Paperwork and Identification
How do you navigate Political Parties?
Do I have to join a party to vote in a primary?
What are Caucuses?
## Technology Stack 
We used HTML, and CSS to construct our web application
We used procreate to designed our logo.
## Challenges 
Some of our team members are beginners to web-development and git so it was at hard to figure out at first, but we managed to push through and learned from each other
