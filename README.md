Galactic Vote takes voting out of this world! Our website is meant to simplify the voting registration process by educating college students on how to vote, according to their status (in-state or out of state). 

***NOTE***
This web application was completed at the Spark! Mini Hackathon at Boston University and due to the time constraint of 8 hours, we wasn't able to advance it for a full capability, but we all tried our best and had fun :) 

##  Our Problem 
**Voting in College is hard:**
- Adulting for the First Time
- Navigating a new State if Out of State
- Requesting an Absentee Ballot?
- Early Mailing Ballots?
- Paperwork and Identification  
- How do you navigate Political Parties?
- Do I have to join a party to vote in a primary?
- What are Caucuses?
## Technology Stack 
We used HTML, and CSS to construct our web application
We used procreate to designed our logo.
## Challenges 
Some of our team members are beginners to web-development and git so it was at hard to figure out at first, but we managed to push through and learned from each other
