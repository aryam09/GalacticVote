            <li>Bring written or printed materials into voting booths, but not to display campaign clothing, stickers or buttons at the polling place. N.Y. Elec. Law § 17-130(4).</li>

    </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Follow normal registration procedures and abide by standard registration deadlines.
            </li>
            <li>Apply for an absentee ballot with your local board of elections: fill out an application in person, request an application form and ballot by letter, or submit a completed application for an absentee ballot (available online in English and Spanish).</li>
            <li>Observe the deadlines for requesting an absentee ballot and for voting by absentee ballot. Generally, an application or letter requesting an absentee ballot must be postmarked 7 days before an election; and the day before an election is the final day to apply for an absentee ballot in person, as well as the final day to postmark an absentee ballot for submission by mail.</li>

            <li>If you live with permanently illness or disability, you may request on your application that an absentee ballot be mailed to you for each election without having to submit a new application.</li>
            <li>On Election Day, if you are unable to appear due to an accident or sudden illness, you may send a representative with an authorized letter to the board of elections to obtain an application and absentee ballot for you, and your representative must return both to the board of elections by 9:00 PM on Election Day.</li>
